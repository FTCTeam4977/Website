				LiveFeed

			<p>
				LiveFeed was created to make it easy to display "live" updates in a feed. The "click me" button demonstrates key features of LiveFeed. By clicking it, you cycle through a switch that calls the "update" function with different arguments. Follow these steps to begin using live feed.
			</p><button type="button" onclick="clickme()">click me</button>
			<ol>
				<li>
					In your body tag, add the "onload" event. As a string, give it the "start" function. "Start" can take up to four arguments: location, height, width, and scroll, but scroll is not required. Ex "&lt;body onload="start('cat', 400, 200);"&gt;".
				</li>
				<li>
					Create a blank Div that doesn't contain anything with the id of the location you specified in the start function. Ex "&lt;div id="cat"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"
				</li>
				<li>
					To add a Feed, you need to call the "update" function. "Update" takes three arguments:location, height, and content. Ex "update("cat",40,"This is the first post");".
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>Things to note</h2>
			<p>
				The feed needs a minimum amount of space to work so height can't be set to below 30 and width can't be set to below 400.<br>
				To customize the theme of LiveFeed, edit the variables in the LiveFeed.js file in the customizable section.
